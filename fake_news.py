fake_article = '''Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, minority leader Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi received an email last Thursday from a Nigerian prince offering the United States access to newly discovered African oil and natural gas deposits in exchange for an advance payment of $25 billion. With most Americans reeling from record-high gas prices and inflation, Speaker Pelosi was quick to put together a bill titled “Securing Carbon fuels for AMericans (SCAM) Act” authorizing the money.

“I’ve never seen such bipartisanship in my years of service,” said Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, referring to how quickly the bill advanced through both houses of Congress unopposed. “I guess taking natural resources from developing countries is one of things we can still get politicians on both sides of the aisle to agree on.”

President Biden initially expressed reservations about the bill but ultimately signed the bill into law after intense lobbying from the CEOs of ExxonMobil (XOM: $87.83) and Chevron Corporation (CVX: $171.59). “Along with the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, this piece of legislation will create new jobs and help cut inflation for everyday Americans,” the President said in a speech on Monday. The money was wired to the Nigerian prince earlier today.

The SCAM Act is not without critics, however. Some economists have expressed concern over the ballooning sizes of the federal budget and deficit (estimated to be $1 trillion this year), especially after multiple years of stimulus spending during the COVID-19 pandemic and the aid earmarked for Ukraine. Moreover, environmental activists condemned Congress for subsidizing fossil fuels at a time when many parts of the country and the world are experiencing extreme weather events driven by climate change.

Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama issued a short statement, “We are not aware of any new natural resource discoveries. Nigeria is a federal republic and has no princes,” but declined to comment further.
